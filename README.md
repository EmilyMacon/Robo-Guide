# Robo-Guide

## Purpose
Robo-Guide demonstrates a solution to more effectively **assisting customers with site navigation, without costly customer service representatives**. In theory, Robo-Guide would be packaged as an optional plug-in for all Shopify ready-made themes (as well as customizable code for rogue sites). To demonstrate this, Robo-Guide is set on top of Paper Bytes, my stationary company's online marketplace which I created on a standard Shopify theme.

Robo-Guide works on desktop and mobile, but I envision it being even more helpful on mobile, where it would be impossible to screen-share with customer service representatives.


## Set-Up
1. Command **python -m SimpleHTTPServer** in the terminal
2. After running command, access **index.html**
3. View Robo-Guide in Chrome

## How to Use it
Click the microphone icon to voice over what you want to do (e.g., check-out, email someone, create account); click the icon again to stop recording your query.

Make sure your speakers are on! Guidance is provided in the form of audio cues, as well as visual cues (the pertaining section of the site is highlighted and scrolled into view). You can click anywhere on the page to clear the visual guides.

Note that outgoing links lead to the *live* Paper Bytes website, but feel free to explore that as well :)
